# Lexer
- allow `tower1` and the like and treat it as two tokens: in this case `tower` and `1`
# TowerDefense
- get rid of line 122
- do not allow placing a tower that locks the enemies in; this is not [Block the Pig](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-block-the-pig).
- be able to lose/win (immediatly quit exit code 0 for win exit code 2 for loss)
# Parser
- nothing currently: feel free to add
# main.dart
- add source file support
# Multiple sections:
- Parser+TowerDefense: make `view` be an expression (GameManager.view returns an int: 0 for null, 1 for enemy, 2 for tower)
