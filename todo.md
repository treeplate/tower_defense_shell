# Lexer
- allow `tower1` and the like and treat it as two tokens: in this case `tower` and `1`
# TowerDefense
- be able to lose/win (immediatly quit exit code 0 for win exit code 2 for loss)
- get rid of `from a to b (c)` print (line 122)
# Parser
- nothing currently
# When done with all other
- Parser: make `money` be an expression and add print statement
- Parser+TowerDefense: make `view` be an expression
